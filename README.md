### vehicleSimulator
> I built this vehicle simulator in python for my Software Engineering I class in the Spring 2019 semester. It uses OO and multithreading to create a program that would make calls to our SWEI website's supply side API to update its location in a database and could handle vehicles traversing routes generated by our website's demand side orders. Unfortunately, it is not runnable, as the website is not running anymore.

Right now I am working on converting the python vehicle sim I made in Software into a runnable Java program that relies on user input from a menu of choices.
